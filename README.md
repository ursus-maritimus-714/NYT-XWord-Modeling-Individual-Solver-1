# Predictive Modeling of Individual Solver 1 (IS1) Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle

## Introduction

### Project Overview and Data Sources
This summary reports on the results of predictive modeling of my own (Individual Solver 1; IS1) performance on all puzzles issued during a 3+ year (Oct. 2020 - Feb. 2024) sample of the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Previously, I conducted a [comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IS1 performance](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Individual-Solver-1/blob/main/README.md) over this sample period. From this EDA, numerous features pertaining to both the puzzles themselves as well as to IS1 past performance were identified as candidate features for predictive modeling of IS1 solve times.    

Without access to two specific data sources this project would not have been possible. The first, [XWord Info: New York Times Crossword Answers and Insights](https://www.xwordinfo.com/), was my source for data on the puzzles themselves. This included a number of proprietary metrics pertaining to the grids, answers, clues and constructors. XWord Info has a contract with NYT for access to the raw data underlying these metrics, but I unfortunately do not. Therefore, I will not be able to share raw or processed data that I've acquired from their site. Nonetheless, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with all of my Python code for analysis and figure generation can be found [here](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-Modeling-Individual-Solver-1/tree/main/notebooks). The second, [XWStats](xwstats.com), was my source for historical solve time data for both IS1 and for the "Global Median Solver" (GMS). XWStats (Matt) derives the GMS solve time as that at the 50th percentile out of ~1-2K individual solvers providing their solve times per puzzle. In the context of IS1 modeling, historical GMS solve times were used to derive a "Strength of Schedule" adjustment to features capturing IS1 past performance prior to a given solve time to be predicted (see Methods section for details). Additionally, please also see the [EDA](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-EDA-Global-Median-Solver?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) and [predictive modeling](https://github.com/ursus-maritimus-714/NYT-XWord-Modeling-Global-Median-Solver/blob/main/README.md) of GMS solve time that I have previously completed. 

Please visit, explore and strongly consider financially supporting both of these wonderful sites; XWord Info via [membership purchase at one of several levels](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Pay) and XWStats via [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/xwstats). 

### Overview of NYT Crossword and IS1 Characteristics
The NYT crossword has been published since 1942, and many consider the "modern era" to have started with the arrival of Will Shortz as (only) its 4th editor 30 years ago. A new puzzle for each day is published online at either 6 PM (Sunday and Monday puzzles) or 10 PM (Tuesday-Saturday puzzles) ET the prior evening. Difficulty for the 15x15 grids (Monday-Saturday) is intended to increase gradually across the week, with Thursday generally including a gimmick or trick of some sort (e.g., "rebuses" where the solver must enter more than one character into one or more squares). Additionally, nearly all Sunday through Thursday puzzles have themes, some of which are revealed via letters placed in circled or shaded squares. Friday and Saturday are almost always themeless puzzles, and tend to have considerably more open constructions and longer (often multiword) answers than the early week puzzles. The clue sets tend to be more wordplay heavy/punny as the week goes on, and the answers become less common in the aggregate as well. Sunday puzzles have larger grids (21x21), and almost always feature a wordplay-intensive theme to which the longest answers in the puzzle pertain. The intended difficulty of the Sunday puzzle is approximately somewhere between a tough Wednesday and an easy Thursday. 

**Figure 1** shows dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 23 grid, clue and answer-related features obtained from XWord Info. This analysis demonstrates that, while puzzles from a given puzzle day do indeed aggregate with each other in n-dimensional "puzzle property space", the puzzle days themselves nonetheless exist along a continuum. Sunday is well-separated from the other puzzle days in this analysis by PCA1, which undoubtedly incorporates one or more grid size-contingent features.

*<h5>The first 3 principal components accounted for 47.6% of total variance. All puzzles issued from Jan. 1, 2018- Feb. 19, 2024 were included in this analysis (N=2,241).*

The overlapping distributions of per puzzle day IS1 solve times across the entire sample period (**Figure 2**) show a parallel performance phenomenon to the continuum of puzzle properties seen in **Fig. 1**. While solve difficulty increased as the week progressed, puzzle days of adjacent difficulty still had substantially overlapping IS1 solve time distributions. Other than for the "easy" days (Monday and Tuesday), distributions of IS1 solve times were quite broad. Wednesday and Saturday also had somewhat multimodal solve time distributions, supporting the notion that there were "easy" and "hard" puzzle pools/constructors at the level of specific puzzle days. It should be noted, however, that the broadness of each puzzle day-specific IS1 solve time distribution was also increased by the fairly dramatic improvement in IS1 performance over the full sample period. The temporal dynamics of this improvement will be highly evident in the next section's figures.
