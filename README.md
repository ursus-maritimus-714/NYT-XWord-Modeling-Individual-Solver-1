# Predictive Modeling of Individual Solver 1 (IS1) Performance on the New York Times Crossword Puzzle

## Introduction

### Project Overview and Data Sources
This summary reports on the results of predictive modeling of my own (Individual Solver 1; IS1) performance on all puzzles issued during a 3+ year (Oct. 2020 - Feb. 2024) sample of the [New York Times (NYT) crossword puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords). Previously, I conducted a [comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IS1 performance]() over this sample period. From this EDA, numerous features pertaining to both the puzzles themselves as well as to IS1 past performance were identified as candidate features for predictive modeling of IS1 solve times.
